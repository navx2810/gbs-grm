h2. How to begin?

To start working on the project, go into "Issues":https://github.com/navx2810/gbs-grm/issues and claim a task by writing a comment, something along the lines of "fuck you" will suffice.

After that, the mod will assign you to the task and will move the task into the "In Progress" tab under "Projects.":https://github.com/navx2810/gbs-grm/projects/2 If you run into any problems or have any questions, feel free to ask them as a comment on the issue itself. Any updates or completions of the task should be sent as a comment. The mod will then review it, mark is as complete and close the task.
